Description: This is a program to calculate compound interest on a principal amount with values taken from user.
"""
# Taking all input values from the user
principal = int(input("Enter the principal amount:\t"))
interest_rate = int(input("Enter the rate of interest:\t"))
num_of_interest_compounded = int(input("Enter the number of times per year that the interest is compounded:\t"))
num_of_years = int(input("Enter the number of years the account will be left to earn interest:\t"))

decimal_Interest = interest_rate/100# Converting the interest Percentage into Decimal Interest
final_amount = principal*((1+(decimal_Interest/num_of_interest_compounded))**(num_of_years*num_of_interest_compounded))# Calculating the final balance in the account after the inputted number of years

# Printing the Output
