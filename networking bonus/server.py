A server that listens for incoming connections and prints the data received and stores the transmission info in a file.
To test this, run the server.py file and then run the client.py file. 
Alternatively, you can use the Putty client to connect to the server. 
Use the RAW configuration (In the putty session window, choose Connection Type: Other and choose Raw from the drop down menu) with the IP and PORT of the server.
